Custom interior map with Xamarin

This is an interactive map of school interior, designed to be used on mobile devices.
I was going to implement finding paths between rooms as well as approximated location with GPS.

I was planning to present it on the contest in 2019.
Discontinued due to formal issues with signing up.
